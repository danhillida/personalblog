        <h2>How I'm Learning WebDev</h2>
            <h3>November 12th, 2022</h3>
                 <p>This is my first post into my personal web devlopment blog.  I'm not certain if I will continue developing my blog or not, as I've read that creating you own blog from the ground up is waste of time for a new developer.  I think that in some ways, that may be correct, however, I also think that early on it will be an easy way to practice the things I am learning</p>
                 <p>Curretly I am mostly working on Javascript.  I started learning to code--for the fourth time--last spring.  I did make it through html and css in Colt Steele's Udemy course, however with my long hiatus from May until October I have forgotten most of it.  I definitly slowed down when I hit javascript, so that's why I picked back up from there.  I figured I'd start with what is the most difficult for me while I still have the ambition from starting.  Even though I have forgotten a lot of my HTML and CSS, I understand the concepts well enough that I'm' not lost when I need to work with them, though I doubt I can write a ton on my own.</p>
                 <p>My current learning plan is to finish Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript course on Udemy and then I am going to use the ZTM web dev udemy course. Following that, the current plan is to focus on React.  I have two React courses purchased, so far on Udemy (collecting resources is a problem of mine) so I don't know which I'll use.  One is another ZTM course, the other is from a popular Udemy teacher whose name is escaping me at the moment.</p> 
                <p>I started Jonas's course October 6th, and I've started contributing to my github again on November 1st.  I figured lighting those squares up green would help when I start interviewing.  As an aside, I woud like to make time to specifically practice GIT, however I might just have to rely on what little my courses bring up.  That would be an advantage of The Odin Project, as it requires you to do a lot with GIT and Github, however I just don't do well with some much textual learning. I think that is why I prefer the video courses like what's on Udemy</p>
                <p>I'm not intending to solely use Udemy, however.  I plan on slowly going through Free Code Camp as well, which is why I now own the refurbished Chromebook I'm typing this on (I wanted something cheap to pack around and do FCC, bonus points because I can also use the online VS code with it as well).  I am also working through a Javascript textbook as well.  I bought it mainly because I wanted reference material, plus I don't think it will hurt as review.  I'm currently reading a few pages before going to bed, and I might start doing some of the more advanced practice exercises on my Chromebook as well.</p>
                <p>I do want to say that Jonas's course is my first priority.  I have defintely burnt myself out on some of my previous attempts at coding trying to attempt too many courses.  I'm going through FCC because I want to start working on refreshing my HTML and CSS skills, and as mentioned above, I see the book as reference material and potententially practice.  I really want to move on to the ZTM course, however I'm going to force myself to finish my Javascript course as I don't want to jump around.  I know myself well enough to know that I won't finish anything if I allow myself to move onto the next thing.</p>  
                <p>I will reiterate advice that I have heard before on learning to code, and that is to pick a course and stick with it.  I have wasted time and spun wheels before in the past thinking I need to do FCC, the Odin Project, and Udemy all at the same time.  In my head it made sense, they all teach differently, and sometimes add a little tidbit the other doesn't.  I now believe the best course you take is the one you finish. I've spun my wheels and wasted time trying to nurse these courses along thinking I was just reviewing stuff and I would be better for it.  This is not true, I just wasted time relearning things I already knew</p>
                <p>So that's my rough plan.  I know learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a framework is not ground breaking, but it is a solid game plan.  I don't quite know where it is going to take me.  I'm hopeful now that it earn me employment, I'm not opposed to if it turns into freelancing, but I'll even be happy if it becomes a hobby.  My hobby really has always been learning new things, and this is certainly the space where I can do just that.</p>
